# Teleword Puzzle Solver
<p> The Teleword Puzzle Solver is a program designed to solve Teleword puzzles provided in a text file. The puzzle consists of a 15x15 grid of letters and a list of words to find within the grid. The program loads the puzzle from a text file, displays the grid and word list, and offers three options:

Solve the puzzle at once: The program displays the entire grid with covered letters in colors according to the number of words they occur in, and uncovered letters in white. It then displays the Teleword and terminates.
Solve the puzzle step by step: The program allows users to see one word being found at a time. Each word is highlighted in the grid, and shared letters are color-coded. Once all words are found, the program terminates.
Print puzzle statistics: The program displays the entire output of option 1 and additional statistics:
